Hack the Hackathon: Specifications
Connected Systems Institute (CSI) | University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee
April 25–27, 2025

Overview
Planning a hackathon is a complex, resource-intensive effort involving dozens of interconnected
tasks, many of which require manual coordination, constant updates, and tight deadlines. For
this challenge, your goal is to design an agentic AI system that can take initiative, communicate
across workflows, and help manage the event lifecycle with minimal human intervention. A
successful solution will reduce the overhead of running hackathons and make it easier for an
organization like CSI to scale these events in the future.


The Challenge
In Hack the Hackathon, your task is to design and prototype an agentic AI system capable of
managing the lifecycle of a hackathon event at CSI.

From registration and sponsor engagement to logistics, communication, website updates, and
post-event reporting, hackathons involve dozens of moving parts. Your team will build a system
that leverages agentic AI to coordinate, automate, and proactively manage these workflows.

You’ll have access to Azure AI and CoPilot 365 and host of free tools curated for this event, as
well as coaching support from CSI, faculty, fellow graduate students, and industry partners.
Your solution should reflect real-world utility, creativity, and collaborative intelligence between
agents.

Hackathon Lifecycle – Actions for Agentic AI

Below are some of the tasks to consider. A successful solution need not address all these issues,
but a strong prototype will demonstrate how agents can take ownership of key responsibilities,
interact intelligently with data and people, and handle real-world event logistics with clarity and
efficiency.

Pre-Planning & Setup

   •   Create and maintain project timelines and to-do lists
   •   Draft personalized outreach emails for students and faculty
   •   Post announcements across platforms (website, social, campus)



                                                                                                  2
Registration & Communication

   •   Monitor and manage registration form submissions
   •   Send personalized confirmation and reminder emails
   •   Track attendee counts and flag missing information
   •   Generate rosters and name tags
   •   Push updates to registrants (e.g., schedule changes, mentor sessions, location and time
       reminders)

Logistics Management

   •   Create campus signage
   •   Coordinate with UWM 20/20 catering (number of students, menu, timing, dietary
       needs)
   •   Schedule and remind workshop facilitators or judges
   •   Generate event agendas

Sponsor & Partner Engagement

   •   Track communication history with sponsors and partners
   •   Send reminders about swag, prizes, judge sign-ups, and deliverables
   •   Gather bios, logos, and talk titles from speakers
   •   Schedule prep calls and share relevant documents
   •   Send thank-you messages post-event with highlights

Participant Support During Event

   •   Manage Q&A or help desk workflows (via email or chat bot)
   •   Remind participants about deadlines
   •   Notify teams of last-minute updates or coaching/workshop changes
   •   Log and route mentor check-ins with teams

Post-Event Wrap-Up

   •   Generate and distribute feedback surveys to attendees, mentors, and sponsors
   •   Collect and analyze feedback and metrics (attendance, engagement)
   •   Compile summary reports for sponsors or leadership
   •   Recommend improvements for future events
   •   Archive materials and outcomes for future reuse

Bonus Agentic Behaviors to Consider

   •   Agents that communicate with each other (e.g., registration agent notifies logistics
       agent when headcount changes)



                                                                                                 3
   •   Agents that monitor constraints or goals (e.g., stay within budget, maximize
       engagement)
   •   Agents that can adapt to changes or reschedule based on conflicts or delays

Ethics Statement
Hack the Hackathon is an educational experience designed to help students learn how to use
agentic AI competently and responsibly. Participants will explore how AI can support—not
replace—human decision-making, and will be encouraged to apply sound judgment, ethical
reasoning, and critical thinking throughout the event.

All datasets used in the hackathon are fictitious. No real personal or institutional data will be
used.

We ask students to consider the broader implications of their solutions, including fairness,
inclusivity, and transparency. This event is not just about building technology—it’s about
learning to do so thoughtfully and securely, with care for people and systems.

Team Formation
   •   Teams must consist of 3–5 students.
   •   All participants must be current UWM undergraduate or graduate students
   •   Interdisciplinary and mixed-experience teams are encouraged!

Available Tools
The solution should include Microsoft tools, but you are welcome to integrate other solutions.
Teams will have access to the following through CSI’s Azure subscription, which participants can
access with their ePanther IDs:

   •   Azure OpenAI (build GPT-powered agents)
   •   Power Automate (create flows for coordination, alerts, and task automation)
   •   Azure Logic Apps (integrate services like Outlook, SharePoint, Forms, and Teams)
   •   Azure Functions (optional – build custom triggers)
   •   Azure Storage & App Services (for hosting content or data)
   •   Azure AI Foundry
   •   CoPilot 365
   •   CSI GitHub Repo (coding assistant – bring your personal GitHub login)
   •   A recommended list of free tools (shared in Canvas)
   •   Canvas Site (for sharing hackathon information, files, links)
   •   Sharepoint Folder (with fictitious hackathon data)




                                                                                                    4
