# Marketing AI Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for AI agents designed to schedule and send AI-generated marketing materials to relevant personnel. The solution leverages Azure AI services while providing local functionality as requested.

## System Components

### 1. Core AI Agent Framework

The system will use a hybrid approach combining Azure cloud services with local processing capabilities:

- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Provides the foundation for building intelligent agents that can perform complex tasks
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Powers content generation with models like GPT-4o
- **Local Processing Module**: Enables offline functionality and local data processing

### 2. Agent Types and Responsibilities

#### Content Generation Agent
- Generates personalized marketing materials based on target audience
- Creates email copy, social media posts, and other marketing content
- Uses Azure OpenAI for high-quality content generation
- Can operate locally with smaller models when offline

#### Scheduling Agent
- Manages optimal timing for sending marketing materials
- Integrates with calendar systems to avoid conflicts
- Tracks engagement metrics to refine scheduling
- Works offline with cached scheduling data

#### Distribution Agent
- Handles delivery of marketing materials to appropriate channels
- Manages recipient lists and personalization
- Tracks delivery status and reports issues
- Can queue messages locally when offline

#### Analytics Agent
- Analyzes performance of marketing campaigns
- Provides insights on engagement and conversion
- Recommends improvements for future campaigns
- Processes data locally when needed

```

### 4. Local vs. Cloud Processing

The system will intelligently decide when to use local processing vs. cloud services:

- **Local Processing**:
  - Content generation with smaller, locally-deployed models
  - Scheduling based on cached preferences and patterns
  - Distribution to local channels or queuing for later delivery
  - Basic analytics on locally stored data

- **Cloud Processing**:
  - Advanced content generation with larger models
  - Complex scheduling algorithms requiring more compute
  - Wide-scale distribution across multiple channels
  - In-depth analytics and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Azure Services Integration

- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Core framework for agent development
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Content generation capabilities
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Development environment for agent creation
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for specific agent tasks
- **Azure Storage**: Data persistence for agent state and content

### 2. Local Functionality Implementation

- **Local Model Deployment**: Smaller versions of language models deployed locally
- **Local Database**: SQLite or similar for storing essential data
- **Offline Mode**: Ability to function without internet connection
- **Synchronization**: Mechanism to sync with cloud when connection is restored

### 3. Security and Privacy

- **Data Encryption**: All stored data encrypted at rest
- **Secure Communication**: TLS for all agent communications
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to agent functionality
- **Privacy Controls**: Clear boundaries for data usage and retention

## User Interaction

### 1. Web Interface

- Dashboard for monitoring agent activities
- Configuration panels for each agent type
- Analytics visualization
- Manual override capabilities

### 2. API Access

- RESTful API for programmatic interaction
- Webhook support for event-driven architecture
- SDK for custom integration

### 3. Command Line Interface

- Local control of agents via CLI
- Scripting capabilities for automation
- Status monitoring and logging

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up Azure AI services
