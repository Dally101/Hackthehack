# Instructions for Updating Your .env File

We detected that your existing .env file has Azure OpenAI configuration, but for the Azure Marketing Agent demo, we need Azure AI Projects configuration. 

Please add the following variables to your existing .env file:

```
# Azure AI Projects Configuration
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-ai-project-endpoint.azure.com
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=your-resource-group-name
AZURE_PROJECT_NAME=your-ai-project-name
```

## How to Find These Values

1. **AZURE_ENDPOINT**: 
   - Go to your Azure AI Studio project in the Azure portal
   - Look for the "Endpoint" value in the project overview

2. **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID**:
   - In the Azure portal, go to "Subscriptions" 
   - Copy the ID of the subscription where your AI project is located

3. **AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP**:
   - This is the name of the resource group where your AI project is located

4. **AZURE_PROJECT_NAME**:
   - This is the name of your Azure AI Project as it appears in the Azure portal

## Notes

- Do not use quotes around the values
- Ensure there are no extra spaces around the equal sign (=)
- Keep your existing configuration for other Azure services

After updating your .env file, run the demo with:

```
python fixed_demo.py --use-azure --type "social media post" --audience "tech enthusiasts" --tone "enthusiastic"
```
