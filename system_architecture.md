## AI Agent System Architecture

The AI Agent System is the core of the Hack the Hackathon platform. It consists of a BaseAgent class and six specialized agent types.

### BaseAgent

- Handles Azure OpenAI Service integration
- Provides common methods for all agents
- Manages API authentication and error handling

### Specialized Agents

1. **Registration Agent**
   - Validates user registration data
   - Suggests skills based on interests
   - Generates personalized welcome messages
   - Provides profile completion recommendations

2. **Team Formation Agent**
   - Suggests potential team members based on skills and interests
   - Analyzes team composition and balance
   - Generates team formation plans
   - Suggests optimal roles for team members

3. **Scheduling Agent**
   - Creates optimized event schedules
   - Adjusts schedules based on participant availability
   - Generates personalized reminders
   - Resolves scheduling conflicts

4. **Submission Agent**
   - Validates project submissions
   - Provides feedback on submissions
   - Suggests presentation improvements
   - Prepares submission summaries for judges

5. **Judging Agent**
